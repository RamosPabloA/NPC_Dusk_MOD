# Dusk NPC Mod for Baldur's Gate II

**Dusk NPC Mod** features a new NPC joining to the party: Dusk, the Wizard Slayer.
Ardusk Aldant, also know as Dusk, is a warrior from Cormyr, trained in the Order of the Purple Dragons. After a long journey to Athkatla, Dusk now becomes a notable Wizard Slayer who just wants to live in peace. But a dark figure attacks in the peaceful Waukeen's Promenade.

## Features

**Dusk** is a warrior specialist in the melee combat, using quarterstaffs and bastard swords. He has two innate abilities that learned in his youth as a First Sword in Cormyr:

- **Inspiring Surge:** The Cormyrean warrior lets out a war cry of "For Cormyr!", instilling courage in his allies. During the time the effect lasts, they will be immune to the effects of fear. The scream also removes fear effects from those who would be affected.
- **Heroic Defense:** The Cormyrean warrior who has been trained as First Sword, is capable of providing a Heroic Defense to the indicated target, providing physical and elemental defense by %10 for the duration of the effect.

Dusk will give you the chance to get:
- 4 new missions (for Shadow of Amn)
- A custom voice set for Dusk
- A path to convert Dusk into a Good or Evil alignment
- Several conversations with the Bhaalspawn, allowing the player to forge a friendship with the NPC
- Several conversations with the existings NPCs (including the EE characters)
- Dusk can make several friendship with the existings NPCs
- A set of items usable only by Wizard Slayers
- Through his missions he can learn new innate abilities and upgrade his personal items
- Through his missions, Dusk can improve his Ability Scores, allowing him to dual-class into a cleric or thief (depending of the alignment)
- About 100 new artifacts, 80 characters (allies and enemies), 10 new spells \* Music for the dialogues with the Bhaalspawn (will change according of the Dusk's alignment) and for some parts of some missions
