@30000    = ~Ah, if it isn't the captain of the North. Tell me, Dusk, is there anything I can help you with?~
@30001    = ~A group of renegades, you say? I see. And what is it that you seek from the Noble Order of the Radiant Heart ?~
@30002    = ~Hmm... I suppose I could intercede with the Prelate on your behalf and that of your group of humanoids. But tell me, why should I do so?~
@30003    = ~It makes sense... Alright, I will speak to the Prelate, I am sure there will be no problems. There is plenty of room here at the barracks, even for larger humanoids. They can help with daily chores, in addition to serving a greater good for the nation.~
@30004    = ~But first, I need you to do me a favor... as long as your reputation is relevant, of course.~
@30005    = ~Also, I would need to speak with your leader <CHARNAME>. We have a tedious matter related to the slave trade involving men who used to call themselves Paladins.~
@30006    = ~Do this for me, Dusk... and I will convince the Prelate about the humanoids you are trying to protect.~
@30007    = ~Yes, Dusk. The matter of your humanoids...~
@30008    = ~I would be happy to intercede with the Prelate on your behalf. You can go back to the Sothillis deserters and tell them to come to the Order's barracks.~
