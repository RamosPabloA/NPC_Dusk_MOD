Martial talent: Axe
Weapon type: One-handed
Requirements: 10 strength~
@200004  = ~The golden shine of this terrible axe is mesmerizing and eerie. To such an extent that one can see the reflection of cruelty and despair. Perhaps it has been forged with pure gold or perhaps it's something else. The blade is perfect and is fully capable of severing the head of a human as easily as one cuts an apple with a knife.

The handle bears some archaic insignias of the Dwarven language and is so ineffable that it causes pain to the eyes. However, the inscription of Bloodaxe stands out, giving the impression that only someone with such a surname is capable of wielding it.

STATISTICS:

It radiates a terrible power, electrocuting anyone who is not of Aldant blood. Additionally, there is a divine aura that contrasts with the danger of the blade. The sword provides protection against level drain, typically caused by undead creatures. Moreover, each hit has a chance to banish undead from this plane. Undoubtedly, the ritual used in the reinforcing process has awakened an instinctive hatred in the weapon, probably stemming from the blood of Dusk himself.

Typically, the magic infused in bracers only works during combat, as most of them are used to protect their wearer from injury and increase the chances of hitting the opponent. However, there are exceptions and more are being produced every day.~
@200019  = ~These lightweight braces provide invaluable defense to the wearer, including (through the magical power with which they were imbued) the ability to conjure a defensive expansion that emanates from their center and expands to the entire body, providing the wearer with a hardness comparable to that of rock. Even without this particular ability, the bracelet itself radiates life force, meant solely for the protection of the wearer.

// CRIMSON THUNDER

@200028  = ~War Hammer~
@200029  = ~Crimson Thunder~
@200030  = ~Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback and, as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two examples of thisâ€”the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer.

@200041 = ~It is said that many centuries ago, a band of humans tried to bring down one of the great northern forests in Tethyr with the aim of progressing their monetary economy by selling wood and animal skins.
Amidst the destruction, an unnamed, solitary and somber elf prayed to the Druid God, Mielikki, for the strength to fight against the invaders. In that instant, his bare torso was covered with a mysterious tough leather hide.
The elf's burning desire to protect his land granted him the ability to defend himself against fire, gaining a powerful fiery attack and protection against the element.
It is said that the elf sometimes transformed into a fierce werewolf and with fury tore and incinerated some human hunters, achieving the exile of those who sought to attack nature.

It is said that the scorpion-like tip of a Manticore's tail radiates a sour stench of decay. And it is precisely that stench that emanates from the tip of this terrible club, making you suspect that it was really built from ingredients of a dead Manticore.

Finally, after being fully armed with his Wizard Slayer Set, Duke Nathan Benork headed his destiny towards the fight against the necromancers, where no one else heard from him. Some say he managed to defeat the necromancers, giving them an unexpected and painful death. However, the leader of the Order, Socram, managed to bring him down through (ironically) a poisoned dagger that lodged in the Warrior's heart.
Nathan Benork died agonizing, but with a smile on his face. His revenge would have been completed when the Avenger's poison invaded the soul of his mortal enemy, Socram.
The Wizard Slayer artifacts scattered throughout Amn.

// Bellfame's Ring

@200273 = ~Forest Ring of Mir~
@200275 = ~Forest Ring of Mir

Several centuries ago, in the depths of the Mir forest, the nymph Bellfame lived with her beasts. For many years, she protected the Tethyr forest from poachers and power-hungry humans. Many creatures served as her allies, and nature was grateful to her.
It was during the Year of the Tankard that she would meet her fateful end: Bellfame was unaware of the war brewing between Tethyr and the Dark Tyrant of Mintar, Teldorn Darkhope. The evil cleric planned to invade the lands of Tethyr, hiding his Zentharim army in the depths of the forest. One of his generals, the Knight Imperceptor (a title that describes the desire for others to suffer) named Kartlzer, noticed that the Forest of Mir presented an opportunity to acquire power, in addition to being a hiding place, as his wizards identified the presence of a mysterious nymph at the heart of a swamp.
Kartlzer was aware of the arcane advantages that could be obtained from a nymph, whether alive or dead, so he decided to hunt her, bringing along his personal sorcerer and his twenty best soldiers.

Bellfame, who had an innate connection with the very roots of the forest, was warned of the danger that loomed over her and the grove if the Dark Tyrant's men remained in Mir. So, she decided to prepare for the imminent combat, using her best animals.
Baba, the Nervous Mouse, was the one who informed the nymph of the enemy's approach. Then, Bellfame conjured a cloud of confusion over the humans, which allowed her agile wolves to attack:
Sayang, the Worg Wolf, attacked the first row, while Jack, the Winter Wolf, used his icy breath against the rear.
Disconcerted, the men attempted to counterattack. The archers were the first to react. They tensed their arrows and aimed at Jack and Sayang. But it was at that moment that, from the earth and darkness, Uma, the Shadow Wolf, emerged and attacked and immobilized the archers.
Flooded with fury, Kartlzer and his mage attacked Bellfame, for they knew that if she fell, her beasts would be disoriented.
To Bellfame's misfortune, Kartlzer's mage was very skilled in the vocalization of spells, but he did not count on the interruption of his spell by a small mouse that strangely had the power to deafen his opponents with an infernal squeal. The mage had not realized that the mouse had climbed onto his tunic. When he was about to get rid of Baba, Bellfame had finished her conjuration and managed to paralyze the mage.
But this had left her exposed to Kartlzer's imminent attack: the Knight attacked her holding his sword. Just before the final impact, Kartlzer's hand was devoured by Bellfame's last beast: Thiago, the brown bear.
Although, at first, victory seemed to be on the nymph's side, the humans were quickly incorporating and counterattacking the beasts, which had no choice but to regroup with their summoner.
Kartlzer's mage, who had cast a protection against the Knight, was now preparing a terrible Death Spell against Bellfame.
The nymph, for her part, managed to identify the necromancer's spell, so she began a counter-conjuration. But this would cost her all her strength, so she also resorted to a last desperate plan.

The wizard finished his spell and cast it at Bellfame and her animals. To his misfortune and horror, he could also identify that the nymph uttered a Word of Power. It was "Fear". At that moment, all the humans were infected with a contagious terror in their hearts, and fled in panic, lost forever in the leafy depths of the forest.

Bellfame, along with her beasts, had disappeared. The nymph used a magical ring that Baba had stolen from the wizard while it was in his tunic and used that artifact as protection against the Death Spell. Although it was enough to prevent the spell from annihilating them instantly, the ring not only absorbed the spell but also absorbed the nymph and her animals.

They were transported to the astral plane of summonings, where creatures are immortal and serve those who summon them. Bellfame can return to the Material Plane whenever she is required, and she can bring her beasts with her as well.

However, Bellfame's will is such that only those of good heart can call her to battle.

@200308 = ~Libro de recetas leprechaun

Greetings, travelers. I leave you this book with the necessary recipes to forge powerful artifacts, from the hand of the good Michelson. I think everything is quite clear, so I hope that when you gather what is needed for an artifact, you come to us (talk to me first, Michelson is always lost in his leprechaun things).
Here we go:

Cormyrean Sword of Disruption

Dusk, if you're reading this, this formula should interest you. Michelson has noticed something peculiar about your Cormyrean sword: it has been repaired by elven artisans from Shilmista. Surely, it is the sword that was broken when you arrived at the Shadow Forest. While the sword itself is quite powerful, Michelson believes that with certain ingredients, you can greatly enhance it:

You'll need:
- Dusk's sword (obviously)
- Scroll of protection from undead (usually sold in some churches)
- Moonstone gem (a fairly common gem)
- Turquoise gem (a fairly common gem)
- King's Tears (a valuable, rare gem)
- The Book of Kaza (definitely the most difficult ingredient to obtain)
- Gold: 7500 pieces

Cormyr Defense

Dusk, this is another note for you. Michelson says he can enhance your Shilmist armor by adding some plates for defensive improvement. But he demands something... particular. He says he needs a plate of Cormyrean origin, such as a piece of shield, for example. It must be from the Purple Dragon Order. The little guy analyzed your equipment, Dusk, and nothing you currently have will do. So we would need:

- Dusk's armor (for obvious reasons)
- Cormyrean metal (could be a piece of shield, for example)
- Horn Coral Gem (a black gem, quite common)
- Black Opal (a common gem, but somewhat valuable)
- Gold: 7500

Stone Defense Bracers

The name itself indicates its function, don't you think?

You'll need:
- Bracers of Defense A.C. 8 (magical bracers, you may find some in the Adventurer's Market)
- Scroll of Protection from Petrification (can be found in some churches. NOTE: Do not confuse with the magical scroll!)
- Jasper Gem (a fairly common gem)
- Gold: 3000 pieces
	
Crimson Thunder

Michelson claims he's able to replicate an ancient artifact, something he saw in another plane. I don't quite understand what he means, but it seems he's quite demanding with the ingredients. I think it might be worth trying to obtain them.

You'll need:
- +2 Warhammer: Ashideena (The warhammer is golden and deals electrical damage)
- Staff of Thunder and Lightning +2 (un ítem un tanto extraño, pero no creo que sea imposible de conseguir)
- Lightning Bolt Scroll (you might find one in a magical scroll shop)
- Wand of Paralyzation (an unusual item, but I don't think it's impossible to obtain)
- Bloodstone Amulet (a necklace with red gems, quite common)
- Ruby Ring (a scarlet ring, expensive, but relatively common)
- Gold: 25000

Wildfire
The leprechaun claims and assures that shapeshifting druids can wear armor, even when they turn into lycanthropes. I'm not sure if that's true, so the little one told me he'll replicate a powerful leather armor that only Shapeshifters can wear.

Needed:
- Karajah's Leather Armor (a rare item, but I've heard Ribald has it in his inventory)
- Fire Agate Gem (a fairly common gem)
- Scroll of Protection from Fire (usually sold in some churches)
- Necklace of Form Stability (possibly the strangest artifact, but if Michelson demands it, it's because it can be obtained)
- Gold: 7000

Venom Strike

I'm not sure what this artifact is, but I assume it must be something like a mace or a club, maybe even a flail. Based on its ingredients, the result should be very satisfying.

You will need:

- Wyvern's Tail (Michelson says it's a mace made from a wyvern's tail. Extremely poisonous)
- Scroll of Protection from Poison (usually sold in some churches)
- Scroll of Vampiric Touch (a magical scroll, which may be sold in some shops)
- Potion of Regeneration (a fairly common potion, at least for adventurers)
- Star Diopside Gem (a relatively common gem, although not easy to obtain)
- Sphene Gem (same as above)
- Gold: 25000

Larloch's Fang

Michelson says he can create an axe that performs the same functions as the Fang of Lich Larloch. I didn't want to ask more, but I assume it's worth trying to get these ingredients.

You will need:

- Battle Axe +1 (a fairly common magical axe if you ask me)
- Potion of Cold Resistance (a potion that can be obtained at some adventurer shops)
- Iol Gem (a fairly common gem)
- Larloch's Minor Drain Scroll (a magical scroll, which may be sold in some shops)
- Helm of Charm Protection  (a protective helmet, I think Michelson wants to extract part of its magic to embed it in the axe)
- Gold: 12500

Inferno's Blizzard

Apparently, Michelson has been to an infernal plane where fire does not exist. He says he learned how to forge a powerful weapon there, specifically a bastard sword. To replicate it, he needs:

- Bastard Sword +2 (you may be able to find it in some shop)
- Scroll of Protection from Cold (usually sold in some churches)
- Lynx Eye Gem (a fairly common gem)
- Aquamarine Gem (a particular gem, but you should have no trouble finding one on your travels)
- Diamond (a valuable gem, but it's worth investing in this)
- Gold: 12500
	




SECRET NOTE:
When Michelson met Dusk, he became somewhat obsessed with him. Apparently, Wizard Assassins generate a deep respect in him, perhaps because he fears them since (as you will suppose) Michelson is a magical being. I discovered that he has a legendary artifact in his possession, called The Royal Avenger. It is the original weapon that Count Benork wielded when he fought against a Necromancer order in the North. How did it come into his possession? No idea... but the point of this is to tell you that if you find the rest of Benork's Assassin Set, he may give you his ultimate weapon. I'll tell you the necessary artifacts, although all I know about them are their names:

- Calia's Heartbeat
- Breath of Lineage
- Iris of Tempus
- Benork's Fortitude
- Protection of Aznagarb
- Path of the Ancestors
- Aznagarb's Defense
- Benork's Hope

PS: If you get all eight artifacts, bring Dusk with you. Something tells me that Michelson will only give you the weapon if he is present. And make sure he has his Cormyrean staff. I don't think the little one will want to give away such a powerful weapon for nothing.

Sincerely,
Mathyus Davis.-~

@200314 = ~Reforged Cormyrean sword

This bastard sword was originally forged in Cormyr. A typical soldier's sword. However, its craftsmanship is exquisite, with its edge being dangerous to anything it touches.
According to Dusk, it was broken in a battle against a giant troll. Later, it was reforged by the Elbereth king's elven artisans, enhancing its enchantments and adding acid damage to it, so as not to suffer the same consequences when facing those creatures of the mountains.

// ESPADA CARMESÍ
@200334 = ~Crimson sword~
@200335 = ~Crimson sword

The weapon was created from an evil orb. Dusk has managed to unleash its full power, although at a cost we cannot comprehend. The sword glows with a crimson color, blood red, just like the mysterious orb. Despite being the size of a regular bastard sword, its weight is enormous compared to a regular one. As expected, only Dusk can wield it.

The weapon was created from a malevolent orb. Dusk has decided to seek out the Shilmist explorer Mathyus Davis to eradicate the evil within it, along with the mysterious leprechaun Michelson. While the orb's power diminished after its purification, Dusk managed to unleash its inner power, resulting in the creation of this sword. As expected, only he can wield it.

// BELLFAME RING MEJORADO
@200390 = ~Forest Ring of Mir

Several centuries ago, in the depths of the Mir forest, the nymph Bellfame lived with her beasts. For many years, she protected the Tethyr forest from poachers and power-hungry humans. Many creatures served as her allies, and nature was grateful to her.
It was during the Year of the Tankard that she would meet her fateful end: Bellfame was unaware of the war brewing between Tethyr and the Dark Tyrant of Mintar, Teldorn Darkhope. The evil cleric planned to invade the lands of Tethyr, hiding his Zentharim army in the depths of the forest. One of his generals, the Knight Imperceptor (a title that describes the desire for others to suffer) named Kartlzer, noticed that the Forest of Mir presented an opportunity to acquire power, in addition to being a hiding place, as his wizards identified the presence of a mysterious nymph at the heart of a swamp.
Kartlzer was aware of the arcane advantages that could be obtained from a nymph, whether alive or dead, so he decided to hunt her, bringing along his personal sorcerer and his twenty best soldiers.

Bellfame, who had an innate connection with the very roots of the forest, was warned of the danger that loomed over her and the grove if the Dark Tyrant's men remained in Mir. So, she decided to prepare for the imminent combat, using her best animals.
Baba, the Nervous Mouse, was the one who informed the nymph of the enemy's approach. Then, Bellfame conjured a cloud of confusion over the humans, which allowed her agile wolves to attack:
Sayang, the Worg Wolf, attacked the first row, while Jack, the Winter Wolf, used his icy breath against the rear.
Disconcerted, the men attempted to counterattack. The archers were the first to react. They tensed their arrows and aimed at Jack and Sayang. But it was at that moment that, from the earth and darkness, Uma, the Shadow Wolf, emerged and attacked and immobilized the archers.
Flooded with fury, Kartlzer and his mage attacked Bellfame, for they knew that if she fell, her beasts would be disoriented.
To Bellfame's misfortune, Kartlzer's mage was very skilled in the vocalization of spells, but he did not count on the interruption of his spell by a small mouse that strangely had the power to deafen his opponents with an infernal squeal. The mage had not realized that the mouse had climbed onto his tunic. When he was about to get rid of Baba, Bellfame had finished her conjuration and managed to paralyze the mage.
But this had left her exposed to Kartlzer's imminent attack: the Knight attacked her holding his sword. Just before the final impact, Kartlzer's hand was devoured by Bellfame's last beast: Thiago, the brown bear.
Although, at first, victory seemed to be on the nymph's side, the humans were quickly incorporating and counterattacking the beasts, which had no choice but to regroup with their summoner.
Kartlzer's mage, who had cast a protection against the Knight, was now preparing a terrible Death Spell against Bellfame.
The nymph, for her part, managed to identify the necromancer's spell, so she began a counter-conjuration. But this would cost her all her strength, so she also resorted to a last desperate plan.

The wizard finished his spell and cast it at Bellfame and her animals. To his misfortune and horror, he could also identify that the nymph uttered a Word of Power. It was "Fear". At that moment, all the humans were infected with a contagious terror in their hearts, and fled in panic, lost forever in the leafy depths of the forest.

Bellfame, along with her beasts, had disappeared. The nymph used a magical ring that Baba had stolen from the wizard while it was in his tunic and used that artifact as protection against the Death Spell. Although it was enough to prevent the spell from annihilating them instantly, the ring not only absorbed the spell but also absorbed the nymph and her animals.

They were transported to the astral plane of summonings, where creatures are immortal and serve those who summon them. Bellfame can return to the Material Plane whenever she is required, and she can bring her beasts with her as well.

However, Bellfame's will is such that only those of good heart can call her to battle.

The ring has been improved by Bellfame herself so that Dusk can use it. She also reinforced it to provide the bearer with improved magical resistance.

////////////////////////////////
// DIARIO ENTRIES

// MISIÓN 1

@210001 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Shilmist Armor

After a brief conversation with Dusk, he mentioned that he has the possibility of recovering his combat armor, a chainmail that was delivered to a friend of his for repairs. We can find it in an abandoned house northwest of the Athkatla's Docks.~

@210003 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Shilmist Armor

We found Mathyus Davis, a strange elf with green hair. Our encounter led to another quest: the search of a Leprechaun named Michelson.
According to Mathyus, the little one would be wandering the streets of the port. We can recognize him by his red hair and green clothing.
Lastly, convincing him to return won't be easy. We'll have to use gold, beer... or make him laugh with a joke.
We'll see how the quest turns out.~

@210004 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Shilmist Armor

Finally, we found Michelson and were able to convince him to return with Mathyus. We should go back and claim our reward.~


@210005 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Shilmist Armor

We returned to Mathyus Davis' hideout and found Michelson by his side. After a brief conversation in which he told us about his first encounter with Michelson and his subsequent hair color change, Mathyus handed over the Shilmist Armor to Dusk.
He also gave us a book of formulas for forging powerful artifacts, provided by Michelson. If we can get the right ingredients, we should talk to Mathyus so we can forge the artifact described in the book.~

// MISIÓN 2

@210006 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

We came across a curious dog named Demolisher. It turned out to be Mathyus Davis' animal companion. He brought a note intended for Dusk, which indicated that there was expected news about the Cormyr detachment. It probably has to do with Dusk's old companions, but to find out, we'll have to head to the Athkatla's Docks, towards Mathyus' hideout.~

@210007 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

We returned to Mathyus Davis' hideout as Demolisher's note indicated. It was the location of the tribe that attacked Dusk's detachment when they were flanking Troll Hill. According to the elf, the tribe consists of humanoids in the Windspear Hills, located southeast of the region, near a large lake. However, Michelson warned that it was possible that it was not the original party that attacked Dusk. I guess we'll see when we find that tribe.~

@210008 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

We found the tribe of humanoids who were apparently responsible for the attack on Dusk's detachment. For some reason, they insisted that they were innocent, but we found that they carried a purple broken shield with the emblem of the Purple Dragons of Cormyr. Dusk didn't hesitate and attacked them.~

@210009 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk has managed to resolve the conflict without bloodshed. Although he couldn't decipher the mystery of the Cormyr shield, he has recovered it and is now campaigning to give a home to the renegades of Sothillis. We must go to the Noble Order of the Radiant Heart in the Temple District of Athkatla and talk to Sir Ryan Trawl. Dusk believes he can provide a solution to the matter.~

@210010 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk and I have dealt with the renegades of Sothillis. However, it seemed to be a trap orchestrated by an Enchanter named Sornhil. He seemed to know Dusk's identity, as well as my divine lineage. He said that Dusk had passed a test and gave him an orb, which we should take to Mathyus for analysis.~

@210011 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk has spoken to Sir Ryan Trawl about the matter of the renegades of Sothillis. However, before helping him, he intends to resolve the existing conflict with the fallen paladins and slave trafficking in Athkatla. Once the issue is resolved, we should return to Trawl to finish the matter with the humanoids.~

@210012 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Sir Ryan Trawl has promised to intervene with the prelate regarding the issue of the Sothillis renegades. All that remains is to deliver the good news to the humanoids in the Windspear Hills.~

@210013 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

We have delivered the good news to Falon and his tribe. They were very pleased with the outcome and I believe Dusk was too. If things had turned out differently, our Wizard Slayer might be a completely different person.~

@210014 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Out of nowhere, a mysterious enchanter appeared to us. It was Sornhil, and he seemed to be aware of Dusk's identity, as well as my divine lineage. He said that Dusk had disappointed him by forgiving the renegades of Sothillis, and that this would lead to an inevitable conflict. He also gave Dusk an orb, which we should take to Mathyus for analysis.~

@210015 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk has taken the orb to Mathyus and Michelson. With their help, he was able to decipher how to unleash its inner power. Despite his friends' warnings, Dusk used the orb and as a consequence, he has undergone a drastic change. Whether this is something good, only time will tell.~

@210016 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Renegades of Sothillis

Dusk took the orb to Mathyus and Michelson. With their help, he was able to decipher how to unleash its inner power. However, he followed his friends' advice and chose to purify it before using it. While the weakened version of the orb had less of an effect, it seems to have affected our companion in both attitude and judgment. Perhaps it's a drastic change, but it may be for the better. Only time will tell.~

// MISSION 3

@210017 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

Demolisher appeared with a note from Mathyus Davis. Apparently, he has located the tribe of humanoids responsible for the attack on Dusk's detachment. Our warrior from Cormyr is certain that this is the correct target. We will gather more information when we go to the Port District, towards the hideout of the green-haired elf.~

@210019 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We arrived at Mathyus' hideout and he informed us that the clan responsible for the attack on Dusk's detachment is located near the Druidic Grove of the region. According to the report provided by the scout, the culprit is an orc chieftain named Alabarza. We will find him in the Troll Mound to the west of the region. Mathyus also informed us that the orc has a varied repertoire of monsters ready to defend him.~

@210020 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

During the journey to the Troll Mound, another mage intercepted us. This time, it was Valatar, the Conjurer. At first, he pretended to seek gratitude from Dusk for increasing his power through the scarlet orb. However, Dusk threatened him with death, so the Conjurer called upon a powerful abyssal demon to eliminate us.~

@210021 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We were able to kill the abyssal demon summoned by Valatar. Dusk felt a strange call from his crimson sword. He ended up finishing off the heart of the beast, and the weapon has improved, gaining new powers.~

@210022 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

During our journey to the Troll Mound, another mage intercepted us. This time, it was Valatar, the Conjurer. After a brief exchange of words in which Valatar declared the power that Dusk wasted by rejecting the scarlet orb, he decided to send an abyssal demon to kill us.~

@210023 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We were able to kill the abyssal demon summoned by Valatar. Dusk felt a strange calling from his emerald sword. He ended up striking the heart of the beast, banishing it forever from this plane. The weapon, apparently, has slightly improved.~

@210024 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We found Alabarza's lair. However, we fell into a trap, where several minion monsters of the Orc Chieftain appeared. His yuan-ti mentioned a mysterious elven mage who gave him a transmutation spell to his chieftain, with which he was able to lure us. If we survive the fight, Dusk is likely to be interested in this information.~

@210025 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

Finally, we have defeated Alabarza the Mutilator, along with his powerful minions. We should go and report the news to Mathyus, back in the Athkatla's Docks.~

@210026 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We arrived at Mathyus' lair, and he informed us that the clan responsible for the attack on Dusk's outpost is located near the Druidic Grove in the region. According to the report provided by the scout, the responsible party is an orc chieftain named Alabarza. We will find him at the Troll Mound to the west of the region. He also informed us that the orc has a varied repertoire of monsters ready to defend him. Fortunately, Dusk will have the help of Sir Ryan Trawl and Falon and his tribe. When the time comes, a activation gem provided by Michelson will bring them to the confrontation.~

@210027 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have defeated Alabarza and his clan with the help of the Order of the Radiant Heart. Michelson appeared to perform a purification ritual at the Troll Mound. The ritual includes the resurrection of fallen warriors who were summoned by the Teleportation Orb. After we spoke with the leprechaun, we were transported back to Athkatla.~

@210028 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have defeated Alabarza and his clan with the help of the Order of the Radiant Heart. Michelson appeared to perform a purification ritual at the Troll Mound. The ritual includes the resurrection of fallen warriors who were summoned by the Teleportation Orb. After we spoke with the leprechaun, we were transported back to Athkatla.~

//RESOLUCION M3

@210029 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have delivered the news of the victory over the Alabarza clan, but also conveyed Dusk's fall in battle. Mathyus and Michelson were saddened, but also relieved. They believed that Dusk had taken a dark path from which he would not be able to return. I suppose that will now be in the past, as at least Dusk's revenge has been fulfilled, even if it meant his death.~

@210030 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have delivered the news of the victory over the Alabarza clan, but also conveyed Dusk's fall in battle. Mathyus and Michelson were saddened. They tried to convince themselves that the battle at least brought justice for the fallen of Cormyr, but I know that it is only a small consolation. Mathyus and his company will return to Shilmista, not without wishing us fortune and health for our travels.~

@210031 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have delivered the news of our victory against the Alabarza clan. Dusk mentioned feeling like there was something more behind Alabarza's attack on their detachment. Mathyus and his companions assured Dusk that they would investigate further if that was the case. In the meantime, we have a good amount of gold as a reward, something that will be useful in the battles to come...~

@210032 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We have delivered the news of our victory against the Alabarza clan. We have received a good reward from Dusk's Shilmist allies. Dusk mentioned that Alabarza and his clan were used in the attack against the Cormyr detachment by the mysterious Order of Mages, composed of Sornhil and Valatar, whom we encountered. The orc chieftain also mentioned an elf named Kalanda and the leader of the Order, a necromancer of whom we know nothing. Something tells me that it won't be the last time we hear about them.~

@210033 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

We returned to Mathyus' hideout in the Athkatla's Docks. I gave the floor to Dusk to deliver the news of our victory over the Alabarza clan, but to my surprise, he ended up killing Mathyus, Demolisher, and Michelson, using a power that I assume came from the mysterious scarlet orb he absorbed some time ago.~

@210034 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Revenge of the First Sword

After the surprising murder of the inhabitants of Shilmista, a shadowy demon appeared in the compound: Danctian Shadow. The creature indicated that it comes from Pandemonium and its origin derives from the Scarlet Orb that Sornhil knew how to deliver to Dusk. For some time, it had been whispering a plan into the Cormyrean's ear, which it revealed to us recently. The liberation of the demon and the murder of the Shilmistas. Now, we have the alliance of Danctian for a future confrontation against the mysterious Order of Mages that is pursuing Dusk. Only time will tell if our Wizard Slayer's decision was the right one.~

@210035 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

Dusk has recounted the events that led him to become the Wizard Slayer. Apparently, a necromancer named Anthagar was responsible for casting a curse that ended up consuming the life of his wife, Celine. Although Dusk did everything possible to try to save his wife, he failed in his endeavor. He only has the hope of finding Anthagar and his Order someday.~

@210036 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We crossed paths with Kalanda, the Transmuter, in BrynnLaw. Apparently, he was waiting for us to put us to the test, summoning a couple of weak creatures before transmuting them into bloodthirsty monsters. What do these mages want with Dusk and me? We still don't know. But I have a feeling that it won't be the last time we hear from them.~

@210037 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We have finally met the one behind all the arcane attacks on Dusk and our party: Anthagar, the Necromancer. He claims to be the leader of an order of magi called the Forgotten Crypt, a sinister cult dedicated to the demigod Velsharoon, the Lord of Undeath. We still don't know what his ultimate goal is with us. For now, we must overcome the obstacles he puts in our way once again.~

@210038 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We have finally met the one behind all the arcane attacks on Dusk and our party: Anthagar, the Necromancer. He claims to be the leader of an order of magi called the Forgotten Crypt, a sinister cult dedicated to the demigod Velsharoon, the Lord of Undeath. We still don't know what his ultimate goal is. For now, we must survive the fateful encounter he has prepared for us, as he sees us as a threat to his future plans.~

@210039 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

Danctian has appeared from the shadows to contact us. He says he has something to offer us that will benefit the party and is related to the order of the mages of the Forgotten Crypt. Without a doubt, this is directly related to the appearance of Anthagar and the other sorcerers. For more information, we must go to the abandoned house northwest of Athkatla's Docks.~

@210040 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

Demolisher has appeared to contact us, bringing with him a note written by Mathyus Davis. Dusk read it, informing us of Anthagar's appearance in Athkatla. Apparently, he delivered a mysterious stone, possibly for teleportation, to our Shilmist friends. We must go to the Athkatla's Docks to Mathyus and Michelson's lair for more information.~

@210041 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We have reached Mathyus' hideout and he has updated us on the current situation. Indeed, the orb that Anthagar delivered to Mathyus and Michelson is in the hands of the shilmists and serves as a bridge to the final confrontation location. We will have the help of Mathyus and Demolisher. We just have to talk to the elf when we're ready to leave.~

@210045 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

Anthagar's accursed orb has brought us to a strange place. It doesn't seem like we're in any known location of the material plane, but rather in some sort of arcane pocket from which we cannot escape until we confront the Forgotten Crypt. We have no sign of Mathyus or Demolisher. I hope they arrive in time for the battle.~

@210043 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

We have arrived at Danctian's hideout. He informed us that Anthagar, the Necromancer, has made contact with him. The strange thing is that Dusk seemed to be aware of this. They may be communicating from a distance, as they seem to be connected in some way. In any case, he has informed us that the Forgotten Crypt plans a massacre in Faerûn in order to gain immortality. But they require me and Dusk to accomplish this. When we are ready for such a encounter, we need only speak to Danctian and ask him to take us there.~

@210044 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The accursed orb of Anthagar has brought us to a strange place. It doesn't seem like we are in any known location of the material plane, but rather in some kind of arcane pocket from which we cannot escape until we confront the Forgotten Crypt. We should explore a bit, but not without preparing for any eventuality...~

@210045 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The dark orb of Anthagar has brought us to a strange place. It doesn't seem like we are in any known place on the material plane, but rather in some kind of arcane pocket from which we cannot escape until we confront the Forgotten Crypt. We have no signs of Mathyus or Demolisher. I hope they arrive in time for the battle.~


// FINAL MISSION GOOD PATH
@210046 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The Forgotten Crypt was defeated. In the process, we had to face Mathyus, who had been enchanted by the Order of Magi of Anthagar. We had no other choice but to kill him, along with the rest of the Order. However, at the end of the battle, after retrieving the Symbol of Velsharoon and the body of the Shilmist elf, Michelson appeared. The leprechaun revived his friend and took us back to Athkatla. With Mathyus revived and everyone else safe, we were teleported to a kind of forest where Dusk could see his wife Celine for the last time.

Finally, back at Mathyus' lair, we were rewarded with gold and entrusted with the mission to defeat Irenicus and save the elves of Suldanessellar. In addition, we can always count on the guardians of Shilmista in case we want to forge any artifact from Michelson's list.~

@210047 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The Forgotten Crypt was defeated. In the process, we had to face Mathyus, who had been enchanted by the Order of Magi of Anthagar. We had no choice but to kill him, along with the rest of the Order. However, after the battle and retrieving the Symbol of Velsharoon and the body of the Shilmist elf, Michelson appeared. The leprechaun revived his friend and took us back to Athkatla. Although Mathyus was revived, he realized that Dusk had fallen in battle. The Shilmists mourned the loss but were comforted by the fact that Velsharoon's allies fell into oblivion and their plans were foiled, something that Dusk would have wanted even at the cost of his own life. He mentioned that Celine was finally avenged and we were rewarded with gold, as well as entrusted with the mission to defeat Irenicus and save the elves of Suldanessellar. In addition, we can always count on the Shilmist guardians if we want to forge any artifact from Michelson's list.~

@210048 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The Forgotten Crypt was defeated. Dusk tricked Anthagar, making him believe he would ally with him to revive Velsharoon, the Demigod of Necromancy, also known as Mellifleur. The Order of Mages attacked fiercely and, while we managed to win, Dusk fell in combat.
Danctian, the shadow demon of Pandemonium, brought us back to Athkatla and left us a good amount of gold. After that, he bid farewell to our plane. I assume he has returned to the shadows where he belongs.~

@210049 = ~Dusk Aldant: The Order of Mages

The Forgotten Crypt was defeated. Dusk tricked Anthagar, making him believe he would ally with him to revive Velsharoon, the Demigod of Necromancy, also known as Mellifleur. The Order of Mages attacked fiercely, but despite that, we managed to win.
After the victory, Danctian, the shadow demon of Pandemonium, took us to a strange wasteland where he was able to bring the spirit of Dusk's wife, Celine. There, they had one last conversation where the she-elf lamented the path her husband had taken. Dusk, despite trying to hide it, was quite shaken by her words. I am certain that this will affect his future, even if he is not aware of it.~


// Epílogo 1 -> Neutral Dusk - Mercader

@330006 = ~After the events of the Throne of Bhaal, Dusk headed to Athkatla. He tried to set up a shop to buy and sell strange artifacts and even received advice from Ribald Barterman. However, his venture failed as he spent most of his time mediating between the Shadow Thieves and the Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, avoiding several conflicts. This, along with the deeds he accomplished with <CHARNAME>, earned him several invitations to perform military jobs.

Finally, he answered Thethyr's call to serve as the general of Zaranda Star's armies. It is said that he only asked for the Queen's favor in return to eliminate all necromantic forces in the region.

With bravery, he led the armies of Ternan Grannox and maintained peace for many years until his retirement when he could no longer wield a sword and his quarterstaff had no purpose other than to serve as his third leg.

It is said that he spent his final days in peace under the dim twilight of a rebuilt Darromar.~

// Epílogo 2 -> Neutral Dusk - Dragon Purple Knight

@330007 = ~After parting ways with <CHARNAME>, Dusk headed towards Cormyr.

There, he narrated everything that had happened since his departure, expecting to receive a deserved punishment for his long absence. Far from it, the High Sword of the Order restored his position as First Sword and assigned a new detachment to recover the bodies of the fallen soldiers, now found in Shilmista.

Not only did he accomplish that, but he also hunted down the orcs responsible for the attack. The battle took place in a mound infested with trolls, with the Knights of the Order of the Purple Dragon emerging victorious. Dusk defeated the orc chieftain Alabarza in a single combat, also killing dozens of his minions. None of his soldiers fell in that battle, and this feat earned him a promotion to Sword Captain.

He was known for being a staunch hunter of necromancers and liches, freeing his nation from many potential threats. After many years of service, he decided to retire.

Rumors have it that he married a beautiful woman from Suzail and restored the Aldant family castle on the outskirts of Arabel. During his years of peace, he had only one daughter whom he named Celine.~

// Epílogo 3 -> Good Dusk - Mielikki's Church

@330008 = ~After parting ways with <CHARNAME>, Dusk made his way towards Shilmista. There, he retrieved the bodies of fallen Cormyrean soldiers with the permission of the elven king Elbereth. He then traveled with an escort of rangers to Cormyr.

Upon arrival, he exposed everything that had happened to the high-ranking army officials, offering to accept whatever punishment they deemed appropriate. However, the general of the Purple Dragons, seeing that one of his First Swords had forged a good relationship with the elves of Shilmista, decided to forgive him on behalf of the king.

The funeral arrangements for the fallen soldiers were a beautiful scene, filled with solemnity and nostalgia. At the end, the elves indicated that a trade alliance between Cormyr and Shilmista would be most beneficial for everyone.

This pleased the nobles greatly, who demanded a large reward for Ardusk Aldant. But he refused, stating that he would be more than happy to build a church to Mielikki and teach about her dogma there.

Cormyr agreed, and thus began the alliance between the northern men and the southern elves.

Rumors say that Dusk spent the rest of his life in the King's Forest in Cormyr, loving nature as his wife had taught him. Perhaps, when his time comes, he can reunite with her in the Unicorn Meadows in the Lady's Forest and there, merge into an eternal embrace of love.~

// Epílogo 4 -> Good Dusk - Alabarza's Death

@330009 = ~After separating from <CHARNAME>, Dusk headed towards Shilmista. It is said that he studied with several elven wizards and searched for an answer to an inner restlessness for a long time.

Years later, he traveled to Athkatla and sought out Falon and his tribe. There he spoke with Sir Ryan Trawl and explained what he was trying to do. Although the paladin did not agree with Dusk's plans, he ultimately allowed Falon and the others to accompany him on a 'small' journey.

Together, they traveled through the lands of Amn and Tethyr, bearing the emblems of the Radiant Heart of Tyr to avoid attacks from local forces. Their destination led them to the Troll Mound on the edge of the Druidic Grove.

Dusk performed a complex ritual to the gods of nature and used much of the power he had gained through the Emerald Orb. At the end, Alabarza and his minions had been resurrected.

Alabarza, surprised to be alive again (and even more so seeing that his great enemy had revived him), asked, "Why did you do this, soldier?".

It is said that Dusk only smiled and said that Gruumsh's eternal punishment seemed too excessive to him.

After several hours of conversations between the humanoids, Dusk managed to convince Alabarza and his tribe to redeem their acts, acting as the first defense of Amn, alongside Falon's tribe.

Alabarza finally agreed and the rest of his tribe followed him. It is said that after a few months, he fell in love with Falon and proposed marriage to her, under the light of his new god: Tyr.

As for Dusk, it is said that he traveled to many places, protecting the weak at the first opportunity. He was able to obtain forgiveness in Cormyr, restore the curse in the Trinity Castle with the help of Elbereth and Mathyus and visit Michelson and Demolisher in Shilmista.

Years passed and when his time was coming, somewhere in the King's Forest in Cormyr, a divine light emerged from a hollow oak tree. Mielikki, the Lady of the Forest, came out of it and carried a tired and worn Ardusk Aldant in her arms.

It is said that they crossed the light of the oak and traveled across oceans of stars until they reached the Unicorn Meadow. There, a shining effigy appeared before him: He was no longer old, his wrinkles and bodily pains had disappeared; and in front of him, a beautiful elf with hair as golden as the sun smiled at him.

"Celine..." he whispered. And he went to her, embracing her while the wild harmony around him danced in an autumn breeze. Now, Dusk and Celine would be together forever.~

// Epílogo 5 -> Good Dusk - Bellfame's War

@330010 = ~The Year of the Tankard was passing in the world when Kartlzer, the Imperceptor Knight of Zentharim, invaded the Mir Forest. He crossed the forest's boundaries and ventured in to take refuge from the troops of Thethyr, with whom they would soon be at war.

His mage sensed the presence of a powerful nymph, whom they could use, alive or dead, for their cruel purposes. It was then that Kartlzer advanced to the heart of the forest with a mage and twenty warriors.

Upon reaching a glaucous mangrove, the villains encountered a particular effigy: the nymph, Bellfame, awaited them surrounded by a bear, three wolves, and a small mouse on her shoulder.

Kartlzer stepped forward and demanded the surrender of the nymph, in exchange for not killing her beasts. However, the nymph, silent, only watched him with some suspicion. It was then that Kartlzer noticed another presence.

From the shadows, a knight in green and purple armor, with the symbol of the Purple Dragon on his chest, appeared.

"I am Ardusk Aldant, First Sword of Cormyr, Knight of the Order of the Purple Dragons and Guardian of Shilmista. If you want to leave here alive, turn around... otherwise, you and all your men will die here, today."

Kartlzer had heard about him and his exploits with <CHARNAME>. It could very well be a trick, but something in Dusk's figure convinced him otherwise.

Finally, the Imperceptor Knight turned around and left quickly from where he came.

Dusk looked at his closed fist in surprise. He opened it, but there was nothing there: The Forest Ring of Mir was in his hand and had disappeared.

Bellfame smiled for the first time: "You did it, Ardusk. You saved us... you changed my fate."

Both embraced and there, Bellfame loved a mortal for the first time.

Dusk spent the rest of his days in Mir with the beasts and plants of the forest he loved so much.~

// Epílogo 6 -> Evil Dusk - NO tiene espada escarlata (Mata a Sothillis)

@330011 = ~After his separation from <CHARNAME>, Dusk headed to Tethyr. There, he founded a mercenary company called the Scarlet Guard and placed himself under the command of Zaranda Star, protecting the region from potential enemies. But rumors indicate that Dusk, a few years later, instigated the start of the war against the Sothillis Empire. The conflict resulted in the loss of thousands of soldiers on both sides. It is said that the war ended in a bloody battle between the humanoids and the Scarlet Guard, in which Sothillis fell in battle against a warrior wielding a sword as red as blood.

The rumors gained strength when, in times of peace, Dusk visited Baldur's Gate and left a large blood-stained greatsword there. Experts later said that it was the personal weapon of the ogre mage Sothillis, a giant humanoid who fell in the aforementioned battle.

As the years passed, Dusk's actions became more erratic and mysterious. He never parted with his sword, which seemed to grow stronger with each death he caused. Finally, the scarlet glow of his sword faded away, indicating the end of the Cormyrean warrior's life. It is said that a great shadow, calling himself Danctian, came to take him in his last moments of life.

The last remnants of Dusk were nothing more than shadow and dust, but some arcane scholars mention that they can find a familiar and eerie presence in the Pandemonium plane.~


// Epílogo 7 -> Evil Dusk - Tiene espada escarlata (Redención)

@330012 = ~After the events of the Throne of Bhaal, Dusk returned to Athkatla, specifically to an abandoned house in the Docks.

There, he performed a ritual with Danctian and, giving away much of his power, he was able to bring three shilmist creatures back to life. Mathyus, Michelson, and Demolisher were back, confused by Dusk's decision (who had annihilated them in the first place). They received no response and Dusk, along with his demonic shadow, disappeared forever from Amn.

It is said that a scarlet figure with the emblem of Cormyr helped Tethyr combat the threat of the Ogre Mage Sothillis. Then, he traveled to Shilmista to visit the tomb of an she-elf archer and finally visited a cursed place called the Castle Trinity.

There, he performed a forbidden ritual in which he opened a portal to a forest plane. He made a pact with the Lady of the Forest herself. Some elven guardians witnessed how the human unsheathed his sword, which was scarlet as blood, but gradually, it turned grey like the leaves of a cedar tree. A powerful gale invaded the place and the gleam of the sword vanished, just like Dusk's life.

When the elves returned to Shilmista to inform Elbereth, he was already dealing with a supernatural event. Celine, the elven archer, had revived.

Celine, still shaken by what had happened, immediately headed to Trinity. There, she could not find Dusk's body. She only found a staff with the emblem of Shilmista and an armor with the emblem of Cormyr. These artifacts are still guarded with great care to this day in the heart of Shilmista.~
